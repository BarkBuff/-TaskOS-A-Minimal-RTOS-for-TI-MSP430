# µTaskOS

### What is this?

µTaskOS isn’t here to blink LEDs — it’s here to make **real multitasking on microcontrollers feel inevitable**. A lightweight, preemptive RTOS designed for MSP430 (and cousins), built from scratch, in C and a whisper of assembly.

---

### What it *might* do (soon™)

* Preemptive scheduling that doesn’t play nice.
* Context switching with surgical precision.
* IPC (queues, semaphores) — because tasks need gossip.
* UART shell — talk to your MCU like it owes you money.
* Tiny footprint (< 8KB RAM) → bigger brains optional.

---

### Why bother?

Because “blinky” demos are cute, but **real engineers** want kernels that fight for every cycle. This isn’t Arduino vibes — it’s **systems software at the hardware boundary**.

---

### Repo Status

Project not yet started.
Currently in **design + evil scheming phase**.
Expect suspicious commits soon.

---

### Follow the chaos

* **Devlog drops** will explain decisions, tradeoffs, and bugs-that-are-features.
* First milestone: a **scheduler demo** that won’t sleep.
* Long-term goal: make TI-RTOS look over its shoulder.

### Disclaimer

If you came here expecting stable code — come back later.
If you came here for *vibes, kernels, and chaos* — welcome aboard.
